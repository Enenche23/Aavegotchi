### **Aavegotchis**
Aavegotchis are ERC721 NFTs represented by onchain SVG layers. Each Aavegotchi manages an escrow contract address that holds aTokens, interest-generating ERC20 tokens from the Aave protocol.

To get an Aavegotchi, a player must first acquire a Portal from the Aavegotchi Shop, then open the Portal and claim an Aavegotchi from it by staking the required amount of aTokens. The required amount varies depending on the rarity of the Aavegotchi. 
### **Portals**
Portals are purchased from the Aavegotchi Store by spending GHST. Each Portal contains 10 Aavegotchis inside it, with traits generated randomly by a Chainlink VRF call initiated in the openPortals() function. 
### **Haunts**
Haunts are akin to the concept of "Generation" in other NFT games. The initial Haunt when Aavegotchis launches on Mainnet will allow 10,000 Portals to be minted. Thereafter, the AavegotchiDAO can vote to create new Haunts, and can also vote to change the price (in GHST) of Portals in that Haunt. 
### **Collaterals**
Although there are thousands of ERC20 tokens, Aavegotchis can only be staked with certain collaterals that have been whitelisted by the protocol. Generally speaking, these collaterals are all interest-bearing aTokens from the Aave protocol. Each Collateral has special modifiers that affect slightly the traits of the Aavegotchi. Which Collateral must be staked within an Aavegotchi is randomly decided by the Chainlink VRF, along with its traits.
### **Traits**
Traits are numeric values generated from the Chainlink VRF random number assigned to each Aavegotchi. Initially, the value of each trait ranges from 0-99, but they can also go lower or higher depending on various influence, such as collateral modifiers, equipped Wearables, and even boosts from Consumables. Traits are distributed on a bell-curve, with the lowest and highest extremes giving the highest rarityScore to the Aavegotchi. 
### **Rarity**
The base rarity score of an Aavegotch is calculated by adding up the rarity of all its numericTraits, including bonuses from equipped wearables, collateral modifiers and consumable bonuses. 
### **Items** 
There are three types of Items in Aavegotchi.

**Wearables** can be equipped by the Aavegotchi and provide bonuses to its traits.

**Consumables** cannot be equipped, but can be consumed (burned) to provide temporary or permanent bonuses to the Aavegotchi's stats, including kinship, experience, and traits.

**Badges** cannot be equipped or used by the Aavegotchi, but are nevertheless held in its inventory as a sort of "diary" of the events in which it has participated.
### **Kinship**
Kinship is a dynamic number that increases or decreases based on the owner's interaction with the Aavegotchi. Kinship starts at 50 for every new Aavegotchi and can be increased by interacting with the Aavegotchi every 12 hours. It can also be additionally increased by consuming Kinship potions. 
### **Level**
An Aavegotchi's level is based on its accrued experience. Aavegotchis can gain experience by consuming certain experience-giving items, or by participating in certain events and getting rewarded by the AavegotchiDAO. Every three levels, an Aavegotchi gets a skillPoint which can be assigned towards increasing one of its numericTraits. 

# **V3 Overview**

The Aave Protocol is decentralised non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as suppliers, borrowers or liquidators. Suppliers provide liquidity to a market and can earn interest on the crypto assets provided, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized fashion. Borrowers can also engage in one-block borrow transactions (”flash loans”), which do not require overcollateralization.

V3 of the Aave Protocol augments the core concepts of Aave Protocol (aTokens, instant liquidity, stable rate borrowing, credit delegation, etc.) with new features in following area.

Pool Logic

DefaultReserveInterestRateStrategy

Implements the calculation of the interest rates depending on the reserve state. This contract holds the information needed to calculate and update the yield relating to specific liquidity pools.

Each contract stores the optimized base curves using the corresponding parameters of each asset. This means that there is a mathematical function which determines the yield of each liquidity pool, with the yield changing based on the amount of borrowed funds and the total liquidity (i.e. utilization) of the pool.

**
39 contract Pool is VersionedInitializable, PoolStorage, IPool {

This code defines a Solidity contract named **Pool**. The contract inherits from two other contracts: **VersionedInitializable** and **PoolStorage**, as well as an interface **IPool**.

**VersionedInitializable** is likely a custom contract that implements a versioning mechanism for the **Pool** contract. **PoolStorage** is likely another custom contract that defines the storage layout for the **Pool** contract.

**IPool** is an interface, which means it defines a set of function signatures that must be implemented by any contract that inherits from it. Contracts that implement the **IPool** interface must provide implementations for all functions defined in the interface.

Without more context or code, it's difficult to say exactly what this contract does. However, based on the names of the contracts it inherits from, it seems likely that **Pool** is some kind of versioned pool contract with custom storage.

40 using ReserveLogic for DataTypes.ReserveData;

This line of code is importing the Solidity contract **ReserveLogic** and using it to extend the functionality of the **DataTypes.ReserveData** struct

By using **ReserveLogic** for **DataTypes.ReserveData**, the functions defined in the **ReserveLogic** contract can be called directly on instances of the **DataTypes.ReserveData** struct without having to first create an instance of the **ReserveLogic** contract.

42 uint256 public constant POOL\_REVISION = 0x1;

43 IPoolAddressesProvider public immutable ADDRESSES\_PROVIDER;

This is a code snippet written in Solidity, a programming language used for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

The first line defines a public constant variable called **POOL\_REVISION** with a data type of **uint256**. The value of this variable is set to **0x1**, which is the hexadecimal representation of the integer 1.

The second line defines a public immutable variable called **ADDRESSES\_PROVIDER** with a data type of **IPoolAddressesProvider**. The **immutable** keyword means that this variable cannot be changed once it has been initialized. The **IPoolAddressesProvider** is a custom interface defined elsewhere in the code, which likely provides the addresses of various contracts used by this smart contract.

Overall, this code is part of a smart contract that defines a pool on the Ethereum blockchain and relies on an external contract to provide the addresses of other contracts needed for its operation.

48 modifier onlyPoolConfigurator() {

`    `\_onlyPoolConfigurator();

`    `\_;

`  `}

The modifier **onlyPoolConfigurator** restricts the execution of a function or modifier to only the pool configurator. Within the modifier, two things happen:

1. **\_onlyPoolConfigurator()** is called. This is likely another function or modifier that checks if the current user is the pool configurator. If the check fails, an exception will be thrown, and the function or modifier that uses this modifier will not execute.
1. The underscore (**\_**) is a placeholder that represents the code of the function or modifier that uses this modifier. The **\_** indicates where the code of the function or modifier will be inserted.

In summary, this modifier adds an additional layer of security by ensuring that only the pool configurator can execute a particular function or modifier.


56 modifier onlyPoolAdmin() {

`    `\_onlyPoolAdmin();

`    `\_;

`  `}

The modifier **onlyPoolAdmin** restricts the execution of a function or modifier to only the pool administrator. Within the modifier, two things happen:

1. **\_onlyPoolAdmin()** is called. This is likely another function or modifier that checks if the current user is the pool administrator. If the check fails, an exception will be thrown, and the function or modifier that uses this modifier will not execute.
1. The underscore (**\_**) is a placeholder that represents the code of the function or modifier that uses this modifier. The **\_** indicates where the code of the function or modifier will be inserted.

In summary, this modifier adds an additional layer of security by ensuring that only the pool administrator can execute a particular function or modifier.

64 modifier onlyBridge() {

`    `\_onlyBridge();

`    `\_;

`  `}

This modifier seems to be defined to restrict the access to a function to only a designated "bridge" address. The underscore character (**\_**) in Solidity is used as a placeholder to indicate where the modified function code will be executed.

The modifier **onlyBridge** calls another function **\_onlyBridge()** which presumably checks that the sender of the transaction is the designated bridge address. If the sender is not the bridge, then an exception will be thrown and the modified function will not execute. If the sender is the bridge, then the underscore (**\_**) acts as a placeholder for the modified function code and it will execute.
